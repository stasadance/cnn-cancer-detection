# cnn-cancer-detection

The project aims to train a convolutional neural network to determine whether a given image of body tissue, obtained from a pathology scan, indicates the presence of cancer. It's a binary classification challenge where each sample is tagged either as cancerous (1) or non-cancerous (0). Here, "cancerous" denotes that at least one pixel in the image shows tumorous tissue.

### Source

Data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition: [Histopathologic Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection).

### Training Data
- **Number of Images:** 220,025
- **Labeling:** Each image is labeled as cancerous (1) or non-cancerous (0).

### Test Data
- **Number of Images:** 57,458
- **Labeling:** The test images are unlabeled
